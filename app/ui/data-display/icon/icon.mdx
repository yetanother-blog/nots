# Iconography

Icons are used to represent actions, objects, and concepts. They are used to communicate meaning without using words. Icons are also used to help users navigate and understand the interface.

<IconGallery>
  {Object.keys(icons).map((icon) => (
      <IconItem name={icon}>
        <Icon icon={icon} />
      </IconItem>
    ))}
</IconGallery>

# Custom Styles

The Icon component supports custom styles by passing the `className` prop to it. Since we use TailwindCSS you can add any utility class to the component you need.
In this case we just add some `color`:

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story of={IconStories.CustomStyles} />
</Canvas>

You can also take advantage of the `currentColor` value to inherit the color from the parent element:

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story of={IconStories.CustomStylesWithCurrentColor} />
</Canvas>
